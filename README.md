# Project-6-Drawing
Drawing application

/*
When the user clicks into the drawing space, the pen is activated.
The user can now move the mouse to draw. 
When the user clicks again, the pen is de-activated and no longer draws. 
Important Note: The user does not click-and-drag to draw. 
The functionality is: a) click once to turn on, b) move to draw, c) click once to turn off.
The user can select from three different pen colors.
The program displays whether the pen is on or off (in "draw" mode or "off").
There is a clear button that clears the entire drawing space. (Hint: think about emptying a list!)
Extra Credit A: An Eraser (15 points)
Add support for an eraser. 
When the eraser is activated, the user can remove previously drawn points from the drawing space. 
For full extra credit, the points should actually be removed.
To complete this extra credit, add a third state for the pen: it is now draw/off/erase. (Hint: consider using an enum!)
Hint: use an iterator and check out the "contains" method in the Node class!
Extra Credit B: Extra Feature (10 points)
Add an additional drawing functionality. 
This must be different from simply choosing another pen color- that will not count for any extra credit. 
Be creative!
